Installation and Setup:
1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8+
pip (Python package manager)
Telegram Bot API Token (from @BotFather)
A GitHub account (for repository management)

2️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add;
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url
PORT=your_defined_port

How to Modify the Code:
Changing the Bot's Name and Details
To change the bot's name, update the bot's settings in BotFather. The name in the code is only for internal references.

Updating the Admin Group
If you want to change the admin group, modify the verification.py file where it references the group ID:
ADMIN_GROUP_ID = -1001234567890  # Replace with the actual Telegram group ID


Modifying Payment Logic:
To modify the payment process, update payments.py to integrate new payment providers or change verification methods.

Adjusting Menu Options
To customize the menu buttons, edit menu.py;
commands = [
    BotCommand("start", "Restart bot and show main menu"),
    BotCommand("payment", "Show payment options"),
    BotCommand("help", "Get help about the bot")
]

Running the Bot:
Once everything is set up, run the bot using:
python bot.py

If you are using a cloud service, ensure your webhook is correctly configured.
Deployment
You can deploy the bot using services like Render, Heroku, or a VPS.

Deploying on Render:
Push your code to GitHub
Connect your GitHub repository to Render.com
Set environment variables in Render Dashboard
Deploy the bot
🔧 Troubleshooting
Bot does not respond? Ensure the token in .env is correct.
